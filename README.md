EDA-TELECOM-CHURN-ANALYSIS

Explore and analyse the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn from Orange Telecom’s churn data.

This project deals with Orange Telecom’s churn dataset of Multinational Telecommunications Corporation, formerly France Telecom S.A.. This dataset has customer activity data(features). Churn (cancellation of subscription) is one of the biggest problems in the telecom industry, as customers are churning out to its competitors. We need to analyse the dataset and find causes, reasons, and insights, solutions, and stop customers from churning out to other telecom companies. This will help companies avoid big losses or bankruptcy.

Data analysis: Fundamental Information Plans Customer service activities are carried out in a customer service center.

Basic information about the dataset: There are four categorical data points and sixteen numerical data points. We have 3333 data with respect to rows, and we have 20 data with respect to columns There is no null or empty data in the dataset. If there is null or empty data, we try to fill or delete data with respect to rows and columns.

The majority of telecom distribution occurs in the state districts of MV, MN, NY, and MA.

The majority of telecom services are served by area code 415, and churn data is evenly distributed among users; we see no variations in churn distribution based on area code.

The data on churn represents that 14.5% of subscriptions are cancelled. Almost 483 accounts cancelled their subscriptions. This may affect the company. This may lead to a huge loss or bankruptcy.

The distribution of churn by state (DISTRICTS): The distribution of telecom districts with respect to churn. We can observe that some districts have a 25–40% churn rate, such as (TX, NJ, MD, CA). This may change in the future.

We can conclude from both data that international plans have a high churn rate and a lag somewhere between plan price and service.

ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO CALL DATA:

Total calls have a higher churn rate of 18%, while international calls have a 14% churn rate.

CHURN DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AND TOTAL MINUTES WITH RESPECT TO PLANS The churn rate is higher in international calls, which is 93%, whereas total voice calls have a 5% churn rate.

VISUALIZATION WITH RESPECT TO CALL DATA (DAY, EVEN, NIGHT, AND INTERNATIONAL DATA): All the data has a similar distribution and we cannot see any variation except changes in charges of day time by which minutes are also decreasing.

Calls to customer service

Most customer service calls are 1. Customer service calls with respect to Churn:

Customers with four or more customer service calls have a high churn rate.

The heat map in relation to the telecom dataset

From the heatmap, we can see that there is a linear dependency between minutes and charge with respect to day, evening, international, and night.

CONCLUSIONS:

Based on my analysis of the dataset, I conclude:

International plans have a high churn rate, both based on plans and no plans. Plans and prices should be revised based on the needs of the customer.

normal churn rate on normal calls. I think this may be because of the high charges for day users Plans for the day, evening, and night should be combined to create a better plan for all users, both planned and unplanned.

Customers with four or more customer service calls have a high churn rate. proper team with support for customer service calls, repetitive validations of calls on service, Set up surveys and feedback from customers for service
