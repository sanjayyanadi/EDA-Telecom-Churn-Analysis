# EDA-TELECOM-CHURN-ANALYSIS
Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn from The Orange Telecom’s churn data

This Project deals with The Orange Telecom’s churn dataset of Multinational Telecommunications Corporation formerly France telecom S.A., This dataset has customer activity data(features), Churn (cancellation of subscription) is a one of the biggest Problem in the telecom industry, and as customers are churning out to its competitors. We need to analyze the dataset and find cause /reasons and insights/solutions and stop customers from churning out to other telecom companies. this will help companies from big loss/bankruptcy

Analyze data with respect to:
Basic functions
Plans
Customer call activities
Customer service center

TELECOM DISTRICT DISTRIBUTION OF STATE:
Most telecom distribution done in MV, MN, NY, and MA district of state

TELECOM STATE CODE SISTRIBUTION WITH RESPERCT TO CHURN: 
The majority telecom is being served in area code of 415, churn data is equal distributed with respect to the users
We don’t see any variations in area code with respect to churn distribution

TELECOM CHURN DISTRIBUTION:
The data of churn represents that 14.5% are cancelled there subscriptions almost 483 accounts cancelled their subscription and this may Affects the company and this may lead to huge loss or bankruptcy

CHURN DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO STATE(DISTRICTS):
The distribution telecom of districts with respect to churn, we can observe that some districts have 25-40% churn rate such as (TX, NJ, MD, CA) this may change in future.


DISTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL PLAN AND VOICE MAIL PLAN  WITH RESPECT TO CHURN RATE:
International plan as 323 users in that 137 people churned out (cancelled subscription)
Voice mail plan as 922 users in that 80 people churned out (cancelled subscription)
From both the data we can conclude that international plan has high churn rate and lags somewhere between plan price or service.


ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO CALL DATA:


CHURN DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AND TOTAL MINUTES WITH RESPECT TO NO PLANS
The churn rate is higher in total calls which is 18% whereas international as 14% churn rate 

CHURN DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AND TOTAL MINUTES WITH RESPECT TO PLANS
The churn rate is higher in international calls which is 93% whereas total voice calls as 5% churn rate 

VISUALIZATION WITH RESPECT TO CALL DATA (DAY, EVE, NIGHT AND INTERNATIONAL DATA):
All the data has similar distribution and we cannot see any variation except changes in charges of day time by which minutes are also decreasing


CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLS:

Most number of customer service calls are 1
CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLS WITH RESPECT TO CHURN:

Customer with 4 and above customer service calls have high churn rate



HEAT MAP WITH RESPECT TO TELECOM DATASET:

From Heatmap, we can see that linear dependency between minutes and charge with respect to day, evening, international, and night.


CONCLUSIONS:

From all analysing the dataset I conclude that:

international plan has high churn rate, on both based on plans and no plans
Plans and price should be revised based on customer purpose

High churn rate on normal calls, I think this may be because of high charges for day users
Plans for day, eve, night should be converted into one and make better plan for all users for both plan and non-plan

Customer with 4 and above customer service calls have high churn rate.
Proper team with support for customer service calls, repetitive validations of call on service, 
Set surveys and Feedback from customers for service
